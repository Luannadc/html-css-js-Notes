# CSS Syntax
A css rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.<br/>
> h1 {color:blue; font-size:12px;}

h1 is the selector, h1 points to the html element you want to style.<br/>

The declaration block {  } contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.<br/>

Each declaration includes a css property name and a value, separeted by a colon :
Multiple css declarations are separated with semicolons ;

## Css Selectors
Css selectors are used to select the html elements you want to style.

We can divide css selectors into five categories:</br>

- **Simple selectors** (select elements based on name, id, class).
- **Combinator selectors** (select elements based on a certain state).
- **Pseudo-class selectors** (select elements based on a certain state).
- **Pseudo-elements selectors** (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value).</br>

### The Css element Selector
The element selector selects html elements based on the element name.
